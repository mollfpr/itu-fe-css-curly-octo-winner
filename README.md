## Instructions

Hello, welcome to Ichigo! We're really glad that you are interested in applying to us.
Before we continue with your application, we have prepared this simple frontend test for us to check how you code. Please follow these instructions and upload the code in a GitHub repository or gist. If possible, please also include a link to a demo somewhere like `codepen` or `jsfiddle`.

1. Create a responsive page which switches between the below layouts depending on the screen width
   - When the screen is larger than `600px` the desktop layout should be used, and when it is smaller the mobile layout should be used
   - Note that the exact size and spacing of boxes doesn't matter, please use your own judgement and make something with a consistent and simple layout that looks basically like the example
2. You can use any styling solution for CSS (separate CSS file, CSS-in-JS, etc). However, please do this in **plain CSS** without frameworks like Bootstrap/Tailwind/etc

Feel free to include comments to explain the intentions or thoughts behind what you're doing, and please get in touch if you have any questions.

Good luck! がんばってください！
